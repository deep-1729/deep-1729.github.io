For classification why do we use the sigmoid function and not just $$w^T x$$ ? 
In classification problem what we are trying to predict is the probability of a data point belonging to a particular class. Now $$w^T x \in (-\infty, \infty)$$, but we want to model probabilities which have range: $$ p(y=1|x,w) \in \[0,1\]$$

### Graphs 

A graph is a data structure consists of nodes/vertices $$V$$ and edges $$E$$. These nodes represent entities or objects and the edges between them denote some relationship. These relationships are either unidirectional or bidirection. Let's assume we're working with undirected graphs for the rest of this post.
