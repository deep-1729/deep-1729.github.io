The Fields medals (or Noble prize for Maths) recepients for 2022 were announced yesterday. Four people were awarded this time. 

## Hugo Duminil-Copin (French, University of Geneva)
For solving longstanding problems in probabilistic theory of phase transitions in statistical physics (especially in 3rd and 4th dimensions)

## June Huh (Korean-American, Princeton University)
- Brought ideas of Hodge theory to combinatorics. <br />
- Proof of Dowling Wilson conjecture for geometric lattices. <br />
- Proof of Heron-Rota-Welsh conjecture for matroids. <br />
- Development of the theory of Lorenzian polynomials. <br />
- Proof of  strong Mason conjecture. <br />

## James Maynard (British, Unversity of Oxford)
- For contribution to analytic number theory which led to advances in the understanding of the structure of prime numbers and in the Diphantine approximation.

## Maryna Viazovska (Ukrainian, Ecole Polytechnique)
- For proving that the E8 lattice provides the densest packing of identical spheres in 8 dimensions. <br/>
- For contributions to related extremal problems and interpolation problems in Fourier analysis.
